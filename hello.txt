Hello, 

I am Mahboob Alam, from West Bengal, India. 

I am a backend engineer, mainly focusing on advanced backend engineering. 

However, I have immence interest in devops domain. I love terminal. I'd marry terminal if it were a girl, haha! kiddin!!!

I have trust on Ostad and I belive I'll have a trajectory of resourceful learning for the next few month, explore interesting things, and apply on my daily drive as a software engineer.
